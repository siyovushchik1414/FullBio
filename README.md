# FullBio

Hello there! My name is Siyovush. Currently, I'm enrolled in the bachelor's degree program at the branch of Lomonosov Moscow State University(#75 in QS World University Rankings 2023). My university specialty covers applied knowledge in mathematics (Calculus, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, Complex Analysis, and so on), programming, and computer science(Pure C++, OOP, Algorithms, SQL DBs). Besides studying at the university, I practice competitive programming in C++ and had already been studying machine learning for a year. After completing several courses, I switched to a rigorous study with the help of books. My favorite author is Prateek Joshi. Now I'm working on classical machine learning, especially computer vision, and want to start working in competitions on the Kaggle platform.

I'm confident that if I have the opportunity to get an internship, I can deepen my knowledge in this field rapidly, despite all the difficulties. That and a great desire to explore new things in this sphere are actually why I'm looking for an internship. I'm open to working in any sphere.

If you are looking for an intern who is eager to learn new things and to work diligently, then my service might be interesting for you.
